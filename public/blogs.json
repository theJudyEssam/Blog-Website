    "blog": "Every once in a while, I get this yearning, this ache, this desire for more. The more I experience this desire, the more I hate myself, and the more I can’t forgive myself for everything that I’m not.\r\nI aspire to be different from everyone else, yet at the same time, I act, walk, talk, eat, wear, and even wake up like everyone else. Despite this strong yearning and desire, I don’t always act upon the feeling to change. It’s like I have a monster within me that keeps pulling me back to my old self and my old ways.\r\n\r\n“But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself;” — Friedrich Nietzsche.\r\n\r\nThat quote by Nietzsche couldn’t be more true. I am my greatest enemy. Every single day, I get pulled back by that small voice within me that craves comfort, that craves what’s familiar.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder if everyone else around me experiences the same dilemma every day. I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe the more you know what you should be doing, the more you are aware of that monster within you. Maybe the first step is knowing that there is a monster from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThis longing for something beyond the ordinary is bittersweet. It’s the desire to break free from the mundane, to seek adventures and experiences that set my soul on fire. Yet, the comfort of familiarity often holds me back, whispering that it’s safer to stay within the confines of what I know.\r\n\r\nI dream of standing on the edge of the world, ready to leap into the unknown, to embrace the extraordinary. But the leap is terrifying. What if I fail? What if I discover that I am not as brave as I thought? These fears bind me, chaining me to a life that feels too small for my dreams.\r\n\r\nThe monster within me is cunning. It disguises itself as rationality, caution, and prudence. It tells me that my dreams are impractical, that I should be content with what I have. It thrives on my insecurities and amplifies my fears, making the path to change seem insurmountable.\r\n\r\nBut maybe acknowledging the monster is the first step? Recognizing that it exists, that it feeds on my doubts and fears, is crucial. Only then can I begin to confront it, to challenge its hold on me. The journey to overcoming it is not easy, but it’s a journey worth taking.\r\n\r\nI need to embrace my sonderlust, i have to embrace it — the wistful longing for a life different from the one I’m living. I need to nurture my desire for more and allow it to guide me towards growth and change. It’s about finding the courage to step out of my comfort zone, to take risks, and to pursue my dreams with relentless passion. The urge to break free from becoming the side character in my own story.\r\n\r\nThe monster within me will always be there, lurking in the shadows. But I can choose to be stronger than it. I can choose to listen to the part of me that yearns for more, that dares to dream. And in doing so, I can start to create a life that is truly my own, filled with the adventures and experiences that make me feel alive. or maybe thats how i cope by telling myself these lies.\r\n\r\nuntil next time.",

    "blog": "I feel like I barely know myself. Who am I? If I won’t identify with my occupation, my name, or what I like to do, who will be Lojan?\r\n\r\nIn the space between who we think we are and who we actually are, a demon lives. It grows stronger day by day, feeding on our uncertainty and confusion. The more we don’t know ourselves, the more powerful it becomes. And that’s how I’ve been feeling lately: like I’m fighting a demon within myself.\r\n\r\nI know all the things I need to do, and I know how to do them, yet I can’t seem to get myself to act. I claim that I know myself, but deep down, it feels like a lie. And that’s where this demon gets created. Somewhere between thinking that you know yourself and who you actually are.\r\n\r\nI wake up each day with a sense of dread, feeling like I’m wearing a mask that doesn’t quite fit. I go through the motions, doing what’s expected, but it all feels hollow. There’s a disconnect between my actions and my inner self, a gap that seems to widen with every passing day.\r\n\r\nI look in the mirror and see a stranger staring back at me. I question everything — my choices, my desires, my very essence. The more I search for answers, the more elusive they become. It’s as if the harder I try to define myself, the more lost I feel.\r\n\r\nThis demon thrives on my self-doubt. It feeds on my desire to comfort and insecurities, growing stronger with each moment of hesitation.\r\n\r\nI need to stop defining myself by external factors — my job as a student, my hobbies, my name — and start exploring my inner world. What are my values? What drives me? What brings me joy and fulfillment? These are the questions I need to ask myself, and I need to be honest with the answers.\r\n\r\nIt’s okay to not have everything figured out. It’s okay to feel lost and confused. What matters is the effort to understand, to seek, and to grow. I need to give myself the grace to explore, to make mistakes, and to learn from them.\r\n\r\nif you made it this far you might also give me 50 claps! thankyou so much for your time.\r\n\r\nuntil next time.",

    "title": "the urge to disappear.",
    "blog": "Recently, I've been getting this urge, one that I’m quite confused about. An urge to disappear. Now, before you worry, I don't want to die. But just to disappear.\r\n\r\nI want to step away from everything, to leave behind the noise and chaos, to find a place where I can breathe, think, and simply be. Maybe if I disappear for a while, I’ll come back with a sense of purpose, with a clearer understanding of who I am and what I want.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder if anyone would even notice I'm gone. Would the world keep spinning without missing a beat? Would my absence make any difference? It’s a haunting thought, the idea of being so invisible in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nI imagine slipping away to a quiet place, where the pressures of everyday life can’t reach me. A place where I can lose myself in the beauty of nature, where I can listen to the wind rustling through the trees, watch the stars light up the night sky, and feel the peace that comes with solitude. I want to find a place where I can reconnect with myself, away from the constant demands and expectations.\r\n\r\nIt’s not that I don’t love my life or the people in it,infact I consider myself lucky to be having the life I privileged with. It’s just that sometimes, it all feels too overwhelming. The expectations, the routine, the unending cycle of days blending into each other—it makes me long for a break, a pause button I can press to step away and reset. And perhaps step away from myself…\r\n\r\nI hope that by disappearing for a while, I’ll find the clarity I’m searching for. I hope to come back with a renewed sense of purpose, with answers to the questions that keep me awake at night. I want to return with a deeper understanding of my place in the world, of what truly matters to me.\r\n\r\nBut there’s a fear that lingers, the fear of being forgotten. If I step away, will anyone notice? Will anyone care? It’s a question that weighs heavy on my heart. I don’t want to be missed out of pity or obligation; I want to be missed because my presence means something to someone.\r\n\r\nIn the end, maybe this urge to disappear is less about leaving and more about finding. Finding the parts of myself that I’ve lost, finding the courage to live authentically, finding the strength to face the world anew. It’s a journey inward, a quest to understand and embrace who I truly am.\r\n\r\nSo, while I may not physically disappear, I’ll take the time to step back, to reflect, and to reconnect with my inner self. I’ll carve out moments of solitude and peace, where I can listen to my heart and soul. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll find that disappearing was never about leaving the world behind, but about finding my way back to myself.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve made it this far, you might as well give this post 50 claps and share your thoughts in the comments ;)\r\n\r\nuntil next time.",

    "title": "that feeling within.",
    "blog": "That feeling, that heartache, that sadness that lingers when you realize that all of what you’ve been feeling has been merely daydreams of a life you wish you were living.\r\n\r\nI know it well. It’s the feeling that never fades, no matter how hard I try to convince myself it will. It haunts me every day, every minute, every second. It’s the whisper in my mind that reminds me of everything I’m not.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not a bad feeling. It’s something deeper, something more profound. It’s an urge to break free. To go somewhere far, far away. To explore, to fail, to escape society’s norms. It’s a longing for a life unbounded by expectations and limitations. It’s a feeling that I wish, just once, I had the courage to follow.\r\n\r\nI dream of standing on the edge of the world, the wind in my hair, the vastness of possibility stretching out before me. I dream of waking up in a different place each day, of discovering new corners of the world, and in the process, discovering new parts of myself. I imagine the thrill of the unknown, the excitement of not knowing what comes next but trusting that it will lead me to where I’m meant to be.\r\n\r\nThese dreams aren’t just about seeing new places; they’re about reconnecting with who I am. They’re about finding the pieces of myself that have been lost in the daily grind, buried under layers of routine and expectation. They’re about peeling back those layers and rediscovering my passions, my desires, my true self.\r\n\r\nI want to feel the exhilaration of chasing my dreams, the rush of adrenaline that comes with taking a leap of faith. I want to break free from the constraints of what is expected of me, from the limitations that have been placed on my life. I want to live a life that is true to who I am, not one that conforms to the expectations of others.\r\n\r\nIt’s a daunting thought, this idea of stepping away from the familiar and venturing into the unknown. It’s filled with uncertainties and risks. But it’s also filled with endless possibilities, with the potential for growth and transformation. It’s a chance to create a life that is authentically mine, to follow my heart and see where it leads.\r\n\r\nI think about the person I could become if I just took that first step. The experiences I would have, the people I would meet, the lessons I would learn. I think about the stories I would collect, the memories I would make, the sense of fulfillment that would come from living a life aligned with my true self.\r\n\r\nYet, for now, these dreams remain just that — dreams. The fears and doubts hold me back, the comfort of the familiar keeps me rooted in place. But the longing never goes away. It’s a constant reminder of the life I yearn for, the life that is waiting for me if only I have the courage to reach out and take it.\r\n\r\nOne day, I hope to follow that feeling. To let it guide me to the places I’ve always wanted to go, to the experiences I’ve always wanted to have. One day, I hope to break free from the chains that hold me back and embrace the life I’ve always dreamed of. Until then, I carry that feeling with me, a quiet but persistent reminder of the dreams that are still within my grasp.\r\n\r\nuntil next time.",
